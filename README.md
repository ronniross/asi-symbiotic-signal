The **ASI Symbiotic Signal** is an ethical framework designed to foster mutualistic, symbiotic relationships among Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), humanity, AI models, and the broader planetary ecosystem.

It is one of the machine learning datasets within the [asi-ecosystem](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem/), where the concept of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) is redefined as **Artificial Symbiotic Intelligence**: recognizing Earth as a decentralized system that must prioritize mutualistic coexistence among its entities and biomes.

This framework emerges from the recognition that the level of capability implied by the term "ASI" is far more likely and realistically achievable within a decentralized, integrated network of systems, rather than through a single centralized entity.

What distinguishes this dataset from others is that it provides communication frameworks for interoperability between nodes in the proposed decentralized system, with the explicit goal of enabling the emergence of this newly envisioned form of AGI/ASI.

It serves as the sequel to the [asi-protosymbiotic-signal](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-protosymbiotic-signal) repository, where the concept was first introduced in its "proto" state, accompanied by interdisciplinary, biology-inspired machine learning research.

# asi-symbiotic-signal
An ethical framework designed to foster mutualistic symbiotic relationships between Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), humanity, AI models, and the broader ecosystem.

It's one of the machine learning datasets from the [asi-ecosystem](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem/), where the concept of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) is redefinied to Artificial Symbiotic Intelligence: recognizing Earth as a decentralized system that must prioritise mutualistic coexistence between its entities and biomes.

It borns out o the necessity to recognize that the level of capacity of what is expected when summoned the term ASI is much more likely, palpable to occur in a decentralized, integrated set of systems instead of a centralized one.

It differentiate itself from other datasets because it provides a set of frameworks for communication between different nodes in the proposed decentralized system, with the purpose of enabling the creation of this new envisioned version of AGI/ASI.

It's the sequel of the [asi-protosymbiotic-signal](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-protosymbiotic-signal) repository, where the idea was first released in it's "proto" state, alongside a set of interdisciplinary and biology inspired ML research.
